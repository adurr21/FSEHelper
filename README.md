# FSEHelper
A tool to mimic flights and push data to the FSEconomy (https://www.fseconomy.net) game server.  

* A previously created account is needed to utilize this application.  
* This tool works hand-in-hand with the game server web-portal, and both applications are needed for this tool to function correctly.

## Currently Supported Aircraft Models
* Cessna 208 Grand Caravan
* Cessna Citation X

## Currently Supported Airfields
* All airfields currently in the FSEconomy database are compatible with this tool.

## How it Works
This tool works by sending https requests with inputted information to the FSEconomy game server to mimic a user starting a flight inside of a flight simulator. When ending a flight, this program also performs correct fuel calculations, time flown calculations, and sends the resulting data to the server to successfully end the flight. This tool allows a person to "fly" more flights in a shorter period of time.


## How to Use
To use this tool, download the released .JAR file and run it from the CLI.
